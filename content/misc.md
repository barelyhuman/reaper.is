## Learning

> ### Languages
>
> - Rust Lang [^1]
> - C / Portable C [^2]

[^1]: Love the language though will wait for the spec to be a little more stable instead of locking down to a version, just so it's easier to make updates a little more often for security updates
[^2]: Just trying to refresh skills so I can use it when needed

> ### Theory
>
> - Kernel Design
> - Compiler Creation
