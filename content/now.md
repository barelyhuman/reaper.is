## Now

- Put [Taco](https://tacotasks.co) on hold for a bit, still working on [Stone](https://stone.reaper.im) and thinking about separating the adaptors to different packages

- Experimenting with [babel transform plugin](https://github.com/barelyhuman/babel-plugin-mutable-react-state) that can help sort the _[state , setState]_ situation a bit as that can get quite messy when working on a complex components

- Still figuring out how to be good enough as a developer

### Ideas / Thoughts in the wild

Waiting to find time to improve **_statico_** to handle a few additions

- Add _init_ to the cli
- add a _postcss_ wrapper to add things like _purgecss_ directly in the compile phase, instead of running scripts during build
