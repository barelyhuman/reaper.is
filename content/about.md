## About

### What I do

I develop open source software and tools to ease development and life overall. Dreams of making a living off of open source software.

### About me

I'm an introvert, which means I'm not much of a talker but then there's exceptions to that. I talk a lot when it comes to tech and basically enjoying coding and tech in general.

You can get in touch for basically anything.
