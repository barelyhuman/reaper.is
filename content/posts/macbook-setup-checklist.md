I wipe my Macbook quite often as a chore, this is done once every 4-5 months and helps me get rid of stuff on the SSD that I probably don't use anymore but is there just because I'm not browsing throught the entire SSD.

This isn't a blog type post but more like a checklist of things that I need to make sure I do before I send everything on the drive to hell.

### Pre - Wipe 

Things before wiping the system.

- [ ] Backup .ssh folder, them keys are important!
- [ ] Make sure you make a timecapsule backup to an external ssd / flash drive 
- [ ] Move notes from various folders to the SSD, (make a good notes app idiot!, stop putting everything here and there on the system)
- [ ] Don't forget getting the vimrc and vscode config, update an existing gist or for the sake of god be a little more smarter and put them up on your website, the collections section is there for a reason.

### Post - Wipe 

- [ ] Setup Homebrew 

  ```sh
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

- [ ] Update Brew and install Git, Wget and other base level tools

  ```sh
  brew install git yarn make fastlane
  
  # now for the UI tools
  brew install clean-me visual-studio-code google-chrome iterm2 docker vlc postgres adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
  ```
- [ ] Add ZSH Suggestions 
  ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions

    # Add the following line to .zshrc
    source ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
    

  ```

- [ ] Next up! Programming Language Support

  - Go Lang: https://golang.org/dl/ 

  - Node 

    ```sh
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | zsh
    
    nvm install --lts 
    nvm install 10 
    nvm install 12 
    nvm alias default 12 # most projects depend on this to be the min version for me right now
    ```

- [ ] Copy back the .ssh folder in place and do a dummy connect to a certain project system for the ssh identities to be loaded automatically

- [ ] Disable Keyboard corrections and other improvements from the keyboard settings 

- [ ] Oh, btw, did you enable opening apps from identified developers? Do it then!

- [ ] Lets setup both the editors, restore the backed up editor configs from the pre-wipe, download the needed fonts for vscode and vim and while we are at hit, download Sublime Merge as well. 

  - Not done yet!! who is going to install vim-plug? you think the plugins will just start working!?

  - [Download plug.vim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim) and put it in the "autoload" directory and then run the below command

    ```sh
    curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
    
    ```

  - then we just open vim and run `:PlugInstall`

- [ ] XCode and Android Studio, download them or check if the SSD has the latest version, if they're already there, let's create symlinks from there to the `$HOME/ExternalApplications` so we can save some space on the SSD.
- [ ] Open XCode,  change the derived data and archives folder to point to the external disk
- [ ] Install ngrok - `brew install ngrok`

That's about it reaper, go sleep now, it's 4 in the morning, maybe start doing this a little early the next time.
