## Now

This is more of a page to remind me what I'm supposed to be prioritizing right
now

- writing tests and features for [grab](https://github.com/barelyhuman/grab)
- slowly updgrading [commitlog](https://github.com/barelyhuman/commitlog) to be
  a better cli and a more reusable package overall
- figuring out and experimenting with solutions for
  [jotai-form](https://github.com/jotai-labs/jotai-form) to keep the atomic
  structure while adding async form level validation

> **NOTE**: (for future self) Do not! and I say DO FUCKING NOT do more than 3
> projects at a time, you just can't handle it.

> ^ Wasn't a challenge.
