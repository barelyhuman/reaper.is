## Now

This is more of a page to remind me what I'm supposed to be prioritizing right
now

- close to dropping the idea of [grab](https://github.com/barelyhuman/grab) and
  instead continue working on tillwhen's new version
- done with the base API and Flags for
  [commitlog](https://github.com/barelyhuman/commitlog), now need to add a
  parser for a global and local config for it
- almost done with adding form level validation for
  [jotai-form](https://github.com/jotai-labs/jotai-form)

> **NOTE**: (for future self) Do not! and I say DO FUCKING NOT do more than 3
> projects at a time, you just can't handle it.

> ^ Wasn't a challenge.
