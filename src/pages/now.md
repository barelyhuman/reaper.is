## Now

This is more of a page to remind me what I'm supposed to be prioritizing right
now

- working on improving tillwhen's base functionalities instead of rewriting the entire UI , like I planned earlier
- done with the base API and Flags for
  [commitlog](https://github.com/barelyhuman/commitlog), now need to add a
  parser for a global and local config for it
- learning a bit of rust while writing a markdown based site generator for future use

> **NOTE**: (for future self) Do not! and I say DO FUCKING NOT do more than 3
> projects at a time, you just can't handle it.

> ^ Wasn't a challenge.
