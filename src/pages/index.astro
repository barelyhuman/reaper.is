        # Hello, I'm Reaper.

        I work as a **Principal Developer** at [Fountane](https://fountane.com). 
        
        I enjoy the chaos and mostly found tinkering with different programming languages 
        and standards. I don't have a primary programming language, neither do I have a primary 
        specialization and don't mind getting into new domains. 
        
        **Web Dev?** Sure.   
        **Mobile Dev?** Yep.   
        **Systems Dev?** uh.. kinda.   

        I do **Open Source** work quite a bit, so most of what I do can be found on [Github](https://github.com/barelyhuman).

        here's a few ways you can get in touch
        - **Twitter**: [barelyreaper](https://twitter.com/barelyreaper)
        - **Mail**: [ahoy@barelyhuman.dev](mailto:ahoy@barelyhuman.dev)
