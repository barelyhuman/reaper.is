## Uses

Don't own much, so here's what I work with

### Hardware

- **Sony WI-C200**, wireless earphones with a neck wire, because I don't really
  like TWS that much and these are pretty easy to replace and carry around,
  plus, amazing battery life for someone who listens to music continuously.

- **Macbook Air M1 2020 (8GB, 500Gig)**, Primary "workstation", There's also an
  older Lenovo Ideapad 520 slim to game on weekends and it's also the Linux
  machine of choice when absolutely necessary.

- **Nokia 5310**, calls and texting, in my pocket normally
- ~~**iPhone XR**, for online payments, maps etc, left in the bag/home
  otherwise. more like a house iPod at this point~~
- **iPhone 12 Mini**, the only pocketable phone around right now, replaces the
  iPhone XR till I can find a better and cheaper alternative to the current
  phones in the market.

### Software / Tools

- **Neovim and Sublime**, Code editors of choice (earlier: VSCode)
- **~~Chrome~~, Firefox and Safari**, Browsers of choice, one for development
  and one for browsing
- **iTerm2**, Terminal, used with the
  [minzsh](https://github.com/barelyhuman/minzsh) shell theme for zsh
- [**logbook**](https://github.com/rsms/rsms-utils/blob/master/bin/logbook) - a
  tiny bash binary for managing daily journals from
  [@rsms](https://github.com/rsms)
- [**typer**](https://typer.barelyhuman.dev) - a simple website to warmup typing
  with

... the remaining software is pretty much always changing based on better
alternatives so really makes no sense to list them.
