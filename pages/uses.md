## Uses

Don't own much, so here's what I work with

### Hardware

- **Sony WI-C200**, wireless earphones with a neck wire, because I don't really
  like TWS that much and these are pretty easy to replace and carry around,
  plus, amazing battery life for someone who listens to music continuously.

- **Macbook Air M1 2020 (8GB, 500Gig)**, Primary "workstation", There's also an
  older Lenovo Ideapad 520 slim to game on weekends and it's also the linux
  machine of choice when absolutely necessary.

- **Nokia 5310**, calls and texting, in my pocket normally
- **iPhone XR**, for online payments, maps etc, left in the bag / home
  otherwise. more like a house iPod at this point

### Apps

- **Neovim and Sublime**, Code editors of choice (earlier: VSCode)
- **Chrome and Safari**, Browser of choice, one for development and one for
  browsing
- **iTerm2**, Terminal, used with the
  [minzsh](https://github.com/barelyhuman/minzsh) shell theme for zsh

... the remaining software are pretty much always changing based on better
alternatives so really makes no sense to list them.
