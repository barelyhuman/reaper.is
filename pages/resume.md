## About

Passionate about building innovative tools and libraries that simplify complex
problems. As a minimalist, I believe in the power of simplicity and elegance in
software design. Skilled in various programming languages and standards, I
thrive in the realm of chaos, constantly tinkering and pushing the boundaries of
what is possible.
