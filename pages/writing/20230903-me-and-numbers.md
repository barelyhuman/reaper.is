I announced [rawjs.xyz](https://rawjs.xyz) the past week and well, due to the nature of where it's heading as a project, 
I had to add analytics to it. 

> For people worried about privacy, I'm using plausible so, **no, I'm not tracking you**. 

Why do we need analytics though, did no one figure out a way to know if users are interested in your app, site without having to secretly 
pick up if the site is being visited. Wait, it's not like me to blame people so lets think of solutions we can use. 

I'm not a fan of numbers, likes, follows, stars, visitors, I try to run away from them. I ended up trying to build a simple HIT counter
for goblin because that's one of the most obvious products where the hit counter doesn't matter because visiting the website is a one off thing. 
There's no count or tracker if you are actually using the curl scripts that goblin actually provides.

These numbers change mentality. You end up thinking about increasing these numbers instead of actually building or creating stuff 
that you originally liked doing. The number starts dominating your decisions after a while. 

We already make most life decisions based on the amount of _money_ we're getting as income and that number already takes control of all of the
decisions we make. Do I really need another number stat deciding what I should and shouldn't do.

Not like me to blame it on others even if I'm ranting, so let's see. What solutions do I have that could 
help me get user interest without doing the analytics thing. It would be helpful if you guys could reply 
to this post via email or hit me up on Twitter with your feedback but overall here's a few things I think I can do 

- Open up a newsletter to understand how many people are interested but, statistically mails like these start getting ignored 
after the initial interest 
- Add in a feedback panel on the site that people can use to tell me if they like or dislike the content or if there's something 
new they'd like to see on it. 
- Forget the numbers and just do what I like and see if it works out - I like this, but if I wish to turn rawjs.xyz into a serious thing, 
this is possibly the worst way to do it. 

Point 3, basically depends on word of mouth and that we already put down as an expectation on rawjs, as _if it does_ help you learn 
then you should help us promote it since the whole point is to not keep knowledge bound to just one person.
