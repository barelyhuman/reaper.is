For me coding has been both a hobby and a way to distract myself from other
problems that I might have.

Which, lead me to working on a lot of projects and a lot of them were just
experiments and while I'm still proud of them since I did learn quite a bit
doing these constant experiments, I just recently found out that a lot of people
don't pick up projects just because they don't see any value in it, or that no
one will ever use it.

To simplify this entire post,

> Treat programming as art.

and I mean actual art, not the one used for money laundering, the one artists do
for themselves.

Programming even a small graceful hello world program should be treated as
something you do for yourself and don't expect appreciation for that because
anyone can do it and that's not the point of doing it.

You do it because it's fun, it keeps you sane and you don't have to force
yourself to focus on doing it.

Now, good chance that no one's going to use it. It's fine. you yourself might
not use it. That's also fine.

Maybe your opinion of the project changes over time, that's also fine.

That's the whole point!

Make those paintings, make them till you think it's done or leave them in the
middle, no one cares!!! That's the fucking beauty of it.

**But, I want to make useful tools!** Everything you build has an audience and
there's quite a few factors that impact this term "useful"

- How big of a community does the niche have?
- Are there other tools that do a lot more ?
- How big is your following ?
- etc
- etc
- etc

A few of these variables can be controlled and a few can't be, and that's okay,
you'll forget about these when you start having fun with what you build.

Cause at the end of the day, the entire purpose of life is to have fun (and eat,
eating is actually more important.)

I'm probably not a good source of knowledge if you're building a business...

anyways, that's about it for this, Adios!
