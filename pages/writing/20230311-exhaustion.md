I've not had a burnout and I hope I never do because I've heard it's not a good
state to be in, both physically and mentally.

Anyway, not a topic I can talk about because never experienced it. Though for
the past month or so, I've had to deal with fatigue for quite a bit of time. One
of the reasons for it was that I was under the weather and the other is the day
job's work got me tired pretty quickly for some reason.

It's never happened before so I wasn't sure what was going on but I basically
had 0.0000000001 Joules of energy at the end of the day out of the 58 Peta
Joules that we seemingly produce everyday.

I'd get done with work and then just go to bed, 0 consideration for any side
project, prototype, experiment that I wished to test out and I've only been able
to do any studying on the weekends and that felt unnatural because, I've been
doing this for over 4 years now and I never just fall asleep there's always some
tutorial, some spec, something interesting that I've had saved for the end of
the day to go through.

Either way, it's not a great feeling to not being able to do things you normally
enjoy doing so I'd just like to say that, don't be me, spend some time resting
everyday so that it doesn't take it's toll on you the day/week/month that you
are not able to live up to that standard that you've set for yourself.

Also, it's okay if for a few days you don't have the energy to do anything but
the bare minimum.

**We are humans**, after all.
