Now this doesn't really need a huge write up but I'll just link you to a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/barelyhuman/cab9d7598b3251d3aee04201cb1c137a)
that'll give you the whole `settings.json`.

Changed my mind, I'm gonna link a few things that I'm using anyways.

### Theme

I switch between these 3 themes

[Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)

[Ayu Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu)

[Min Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.min-theme)

### Font

It's a custom Ubuntu Mono font with Ligatures added, You can find it at [lemeb/a-better-ligaturizer](https://github.com/lemeb/a-better-ligaturizer),
or customize any of your own fonts to use ligatures as well

[Fira Code Mono](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is another one that I like.

### Plugins

[Music Time - Control Spotify with your code editor](https://www.software.com/music-time)

[PolaCode - For Epic Code screenshots](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode)

And that's about it, I do have other language specific plugins but I don't think I need them posted here.
