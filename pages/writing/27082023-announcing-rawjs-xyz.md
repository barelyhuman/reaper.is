Tiny post.

I made something: [https://rawjs.xyz](https://rawjs.xyz)

The goals of the project is to be able to help all kinds of JS developers while
keeping the knowledge as unopinionated as possible, we also plan to let other
contribute articles about topics that do need attention are not feeding the
current hype.

The current state of JS is widely dominated by libraries and frameworks which
make it really hard for people to actually focus on JS and focus more on the
framework's change in pragma and usage.

I've talked more about it on the actual project page, so you can read it there

I hope you find something to learn on it, that's all for now. Adios!
