This weekend was rather lazy , I had a few projects I wanted to complete, though
I slept through most of the day on both days and spent about 4 hours watching
the Snyder Cut JL and 1 hour thinking about what on earth was WB thinking with
the initial release.

Back to the update.

# SpotSync

This is a very niche project that I picked up that serves the purpose of keeping
my Spotify library and a playlist that I share with people in sync. The concept
is simple, it syncs the library to a playlist that's it, nothing else. It's
basically done but not tested and nope, you won't find it on my Github because I
won't be making it public unless I'm done testing it, which will be sometime
this week so that's one and it isn't deployed yet so no links right now. Told
you, lazy weekend.

# MyTag

I don't normally contribute to other open source projects I just use them to
learn stuff but I thought I'd help a fellow developer out this time so I spent a
few hours on a few issues of this project.
[MyTag](https://github.com/cryptoboid/mytag)

Pretty great concept, though the app needs a little more polishing and tweaking
to be feature complete, which the original developer is working on, hoping I can
find more time to help such projects instead of just re-creating my own versions
of various existing tools. (talking about TillWhen)

# TillWhen

Minor security patches and version upgrades for a lot of things, I do have to
make the UI a lot more consistent so I'm kinda stuck as to whether I should work
on the Multi Slack workspace support or Work on the teams concepts , also kinda
understand why almost all free services online have ads on them, cause people
won't support it with donations when being provided for free.

Anyway, guess I'll be working a day job forever if I want to keep the projects
free to use.

## Making TillWhen Opensource?

I did announce and also mentioned it on the
[about page](https://tillwhen.barelyhuman.dev/about) that tillwhen will be
getting a self hosted version and I do plan on making it open source but I wanna
make sure I get rid of any security vulnerability that I can find myself before
I do hand it over to the community to see. I trust the community with my other
projects because they are tools and store data mostly on the browser, this one
has people's daily logs , while an attacker could do a lot of damage it's still
something I need to worry about and not something I can just let loose.

Overall point, yes, TillWhen will be opensource and come with a self hosting
alternative after I'm sure that any edge case (hopefully all) security concerns
are out of the picture. While there's barely any personal information tracked by
the app, for someone who routinely logs onto tillwhen, the data can be used
maliciously.

# The Blog

RSS feeds were added to blog on request by a friend from
[here](https://fosstodon.org/@TheCam/105916599587324953) , also re-built
[barelyhuman.dev](http://barelyhuman.dev/) to follow the new design style I have
on all apps and go rid of any deps on Javascript other than the themer (dark and
light mode toggle)

# Rest of the life

Overall just played CS:GO all night and worked on the above mentioned things in
the morning, pretty fun weekend.

Adios!
