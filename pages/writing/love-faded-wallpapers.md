I'm the kind of guy who changes his wallpapers a lot. Like... A LOT!

But, there's this thing that I fancy. Almost all wallpapers that I download, I modify them to have a slightly washed out or faded look, if they
weren't already that way.

A few examples of what I'm talking about can be found on [here](https://imgur.com/a/XgYEs) (note: these are not mine, just examples).

And since it's normally the same amount of settings from GIMP for almost all images, I thought I'd write a service. Which I did somewhere around
`3rd Jul 2019` , exactly a year ago and I've been using it since.

Never really gave it away since I didn't think many people would want to use it but that's not something I should be deciding so I'm going to post the
link to it here.
