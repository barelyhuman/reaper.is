Websites are a beautiful concept, being able to make art using digital pixels
and content is something I really wish more people could do and a lot of people
are working on making websites easy for people as well. I'd say Framer is one of
the few services doing this today.

Though, the post isn't about Framer.

It's about the people who are really fond of working on websites and polishing
it's intricate details to the point of perfection. These programmers are really
fond of their craft and I'm really envious of them. That leaves me with 2
options.

1. Replicate and Learn from them
2. Be proud of my fellow developers

I chose to do both and there's things I've taken up as "inspiration" and to be
able to help them get a little more audience I built something.

**Announcing [minweb.site](https://minweb.site)**, a really simple collection
websites that I and [Arne](https://www.wiesson.dev) find either pleasing to look
at, or show the designer's effort and personality while staying minimal.

Yes, the collection is going to be opinionated but if you like the concept
please help spread it. If you are someone who would like to submit their website
to the list, please do so!

I can't guarantee adding every website I get in request because I have to
absolutely like it to be a part of the list but submit them anyway!

At the end of the day, it's your personality and your website so it doesn't
matter if I like it or not but I have to like it to be a part of the list ðŸ˜‚
