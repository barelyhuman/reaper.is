I've been a fan of skins for a really long time, and
[dbrand](https://dbrand.com/) has been the favourite of a lot of people, mainly
because of the amount of customisation you can do when selecting skins, you can
mix and match various textures and patterns for various parts of the phone.

- A different texture for the camera cutout
- one for the back of the phone
- one for the front
- with or without the logo cutout

and others.

Now, as someone residing in India , it's hard to get the skins considering the
whole pandemic situation and also they do get a little pricey if you replace
skins quite often. I've had a few custom one's printed at local stores that do
this and while that's a nice and cheap option it's not very near to me, so I
ended up playing a risky hand by trying out various skins from online stores
that do similar textures like dbrand in India.

## Alternatives

I'm just going to provide some alternatives for someone who'd like to still
apply skins but for a little less.

To the point, here's the two I've used quite a few times and I'm satisfied with
both.

- [Gadgetshieldz](https://www.gadgetshieldz.com/)
- [CapesIndia](https://www.capesindia.com/)

**I've tried and used GadgetShieldz and CapesIndia**, mostly because they both
kind off replicate the dBrand customization web app and the quality of the
shields I recieved was good enough to stay on the phone for about 7 months or
so, and that too because I decided to rip out the skin and apply a different
one.

Here's the one I applied on my phone last week, a leather one from CapesIndia,
and it's pretty easy plus you get extra camera cover in case you botch the first
attempt, like I did when I first applied a marble skin on an older phone,
totally ripped the side flaps, wasn't concentrating while doing it.

That's it's for now, I'm kinda out of my house right now and can't do much tech
work so this is just so I can be consistent at blogging.

Adios!
