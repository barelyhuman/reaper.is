title: Notes on fixing react native 0.61.5 on a M1 mac
date: 14/06/2022

Here's a few references based on things that broke while trying to make an old
project on **react native** to work with my Macbook M1

### `Undefined / Unknown symbol : , expected )`

This happens when babel is unable to parse flow grammar, so you can remove it
from your source code but there's good chances it won't be able to compile it
for imported stuff as well, you can lock the babel to resolve to a particular
version by following the below

[https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/14139#issuecomment-1011836916](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/14139#issuecomment-1011836916)

### Cannot build simulator for arm64

Well, XCode 12.5 adds a few defaults with regards to supported architectures and
this breaks due to incompatibility. In short you'll have to do the following
steps

1. Remove VALID_ARCHS from **build settings** if it's been added
2. Add `Excluded Arch's` for ios simulator sdk's and specify the arch to be
   `arm64`
3. Modify Podfile to add the same configuration to any packages that might get
   installed using the snippet below

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings["EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]"] = "arm64"
  end
end
```

For a more detailed explanation, read the below blog
[https://khushwanttanwar.medium.com/xcode-12-compilation-errors-while-running-with-ios-14-simulators-5731c91326e9](https://khushwanttanwar.medium.com/xcode-12-compilation-errors-while-running-with-ios-14-simulators-5731c91326e9)

### No Images or assets on iOS 14 +

The rendering changed over the versions and this specific react native version
doesn't handle the change so you'll have to manually patch this using
`patch-package` by creating a patch file for the below addition in the file
`react-native/Libraries/Image/RCTUIImageViewAnimated.m`

```objective-c
else {
    [super displayLayer:layer];
}
```

and this should handle the rendering for you after running `patch-package` again
and re-installing the Pods.

### cannot initialize a parameter of type 'NSArray....'

There's a good chance you start with this issue where XCode fails to handle
basic types due to the difference in the SDK version and paths

You can fix this by manually replacing these with older definitions by adding
the below lines in your `post_install` script in the Podfile as well

```ruby
find_and_replace("../node_modules/react-native/React/CxxBridge/RCTCxxBridge.mm",
  "_initializeModules:(NSArray<id<RCTBridgeModule>> *)modules", "_initializeModules:(NSArray<Class> *)modules")
find_and_replace("../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/turbomodule/core/platform/ios/RCTTurboModuleManager.mm",
      "RCTBridgeModuleNameForClass(module))", "RCTBridgeModuleNameForClass(Class(module)))")
```

The `find_and_replace` isn't a defined function so you'll have to define that as
well, which you can do at the end of the Podfile with the following code

```ruby
def find_and_replace(dir, findstr, replacestr)
  Dir[dir].each do |name|
      text = File.read(name)
      replace = text.gsub(findstr,replacestr)
      if text != replace
          puts "Fix: " + name
          File.open(name, "w") { |file| file.puts replace }
          STDOUT.flush
      end
  end
  Dir[dir + '*/'].each(&method(:find_and_replace))
end
```

You can read more about this on this issue thread
[https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/28405](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/28405)

In case you are greeted with both issues regarding `XCode >=12.5` then this is
how your Podfile's `post_install` task will look like.

> **Note**: I like to move my post_install out of the `targets` block. If you
> keep it inside the block then know that the `find_and_replace` function is to
> be on the very outside

```ruby
targets "project" do
#  pod Stripe
# ... etc
end


def find_and_replace()
    # ...
end
```

So the final output would look a little something like this

```ruby
post_install do |installer|

  find_and_replace("../node_modules/react-native/React/CxxBridge/RCTCxxBridge.mm",
  "_initializeModules:(NSArray<id<RCTBridgeModule>> *)modules", "_initializeModules:(NSArray<Class> *)modules")
  find_and_replace("../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/turbomodule/core/platform/ios/RCTTurboModuleManager.mm",
      "RCTBridgeModuleNameForClass(module))", "RCTBridgeModuleNameForClass(Class(module)))")


  installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings["EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]"] = "arm64"
  end

end

def find_and_replace(dir, findstr, replacestr)
  Dir[dir].each do |name|
      text = File.read(name)
      replace = text.gsub(findstr,replacestr)
      if text != replace
          puts "Fix: " + name
          File.open(name, "w") { |file| file.puts replace }
          STDOUT.flush
      end
  end
  Dir[dir + '*/'].each(&method(:find_and_replace))
end
```
