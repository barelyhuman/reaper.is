Hey, I'm **Reaper**

**Principal Developer** at [Fountane](https://fountane.com)

Mostly seen building tools and libraries to complicate my own life while trying
to ease it for my future self.

Dealing with chaos and tinkering with different programming languages and
standards are my favorite hobbies. I don't have a preferred programming language
and most of my work revolves around web and cli tools.

**My work could speak for itself** (though it doesn't speak much...)

You can also get an overview of [skills](/skills) if you wish to.
