Hey, I'm <h1>Reaper</h1>

I work as a **Principal Developer** at [Fountane](https://fountane.com).

I enjoy the chaos and mostly found tinkering with different programming languages
and standards. I don't have a primary programming language, neither do I have a primary
specialization and don't mind getting into new domains.

**I'd wish for my work to speak for itself** (though it doesn't speak much...)

What am I doing [now](/now)?
